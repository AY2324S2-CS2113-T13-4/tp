--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `SuperTracker.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T13-4/tp/releases).
3. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar SuperTracker.jar` command to run the application.
4. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
5. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command and its format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

> Notes about the command format:
> - Words in uppercase are parameters to be specified by the user
>   - e.g. in `add n/NAME q/QUANTITY`, `NAME` and `QUANTITY` are parameters which can be used as `add n/cheese q/100`
> - Items in square brackets are optional
>   - e.g. `list [q/] [p/]` can be used as `list q/`, `list p/`, `list` etc.
> - Parameters can be in any order
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME q/QUANTITY`, `q/QUANTITY n/NAME` is also acceptable
> - Commands that do not take in parameters will ignore any additional parameters input by the user
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `quit now`, it will be interpreted as `quit`
> - If the command has multiple of the same parameters, it uses the first occurrence of that parameter
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `new n/Milk q/100 p/5 n/Cheese`, it will be interpreted as `new n/Milk q/100 p/5`
> - If any of the compulsory parameters are empty an error is thrown
> - The value of a parameter would be interpreted as the trimmed substring after `/` up to the space right before the next valid parameter
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `add n/Milk q/10q/10`, the command would be invalid as `QUANTITY` would be interpreted as `10q/10`, 
>   since there is no space before the second occurrence of `q/`
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `add n/Milk q/10 p/10`, the command would be invalid as `QUANTITY` would be interpreted as `10 p/10`, 
>   since `p/` is not a valid parameter for the add command
>   - e.g. if the command specifies `add n/Milk q/  10   q/20`, the command would be valid as `QUANTITY` would be interpreted as `10`

<br>

### List all items: `list`
List all unique items in the inventory.
Output will be printed to the terminal and each row will contain the name of each item.

Format: `list [q/] [p/] [e/] [sq/] [sp/] [se/] [r/]`
- `q/` will list the quantity of each item in each row
- `p/` will list the price of each item in each row
- `e/` will list the expiry date of each item in each row if it contains a valid expiry date
- In each row, quantity, price and expiry date will be printed in the same order as the flags
  - e.g. if the command specifies `list q/ p/ e/`, the quantity will be printed first followed by price and expiry date
- `sq/` will list the items in order of ascending quantity
- `sp/` will list the items in order of ascending price
- `se/` will list the items in order of ascending date, items with no expiry date will be listed at the end
- If the command has no sorting parameters, the list will be sorted in ascending alphabetical order (A-Z) by default
- If the command has multiple sorting parameters, the list will be sorted in the same order as the sorting flags
  - e.g. if the command specifies `list sq/ sp/ se/`, list will be sorted in order of ascending quantity. 
  Ties will be sorted in order of ascending price, then ascending date, followed by ascending alphabetical order (A-Z)
- If `q/` is not specified but `sq/` is specified, the command will be interpreted as `q/ sq/`. 
Same logic applies to price and expiry date
  - e.g. if the command specifies `list sq/ sp/ q/`, the command will be interpreted as `list sq/ p/ sp/ q/`,
  although the list will be sorted in order of ascending quantity, price will be printed before quantity
- `r/` will reverse the order of the list

Example: `list q/ p/ e/ sp/ r/`
```
There are 3 unique items in your inventory:
1. Name: Milk    Quantity: 100    Price: $5.00
2. Name: Juice    Quantity: 300    Price: $4.00    Expiry Date: 12/03/2025
3. Name: Cheese    Quantity: 200    Price: $3.00
```

There are 2 types of reports:
1. **low stock** - list all items that are below a specified threshold provided by the user
2. **expiry** - list all items that are within a week of expiring or have already expired

The report will be printed to the terminal and will contain the name of each item
- If the report type is **low stock**: 
  - The quantity of each item would be listed

- `r/` parameter that specifies the type of report. e.g. **low stock** or **expiry**
- `t/` parameter that specifies the threshold value to be compared to for **low stock report**. 
All items below the threshold value would be listed out.

> Note: If report type is **low stock** threshold value must be **included**. However, if report type is **expiry** 
threshold value must be **excluded** or left **empty**.


Example: `report r/low stock t/35`

```
There are 3 items low on stocks!
1. Name: Orange
   Quantity: 10
2. Name: Banana

<br>

### Quit the program: `quit`
Quits the program

Format: `quit`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Saving inventory data
Data in the program is saved to the hard disk in the file path `./data/` in the same directory that
the `SuperTracker.jar` file is in. Item data will be saved automatically after any command that changes the item data in the inventory.
Similarly, transaction data will be saved automatically after commands that add or erases transaction data.

<br>

### Loading inventory data
Data that has been saved to the hard disk will be loaded and read by the program each time it is launched. 
If there is no data file, the program will the skip loading process.

<br>

### Editing the data file
Data of the `SuperTracker` program is stored in a text files in the path `./data/` relative to 
the directory the `SuperTracker.jar` file is in. Users can edit and update the inventory data directly through the data file
if they would like to do so. Inventory data is stored in `items.txt`, and transaction data is stored in `transactions.txt`.
> Note 1: **Edit the data file at your own caution.** If the changes made to the data file are in an invalid format, the program
> will ignore those changes on its next load. The corrupted changes will be erased, so do keep a backup of the data 
> file before editing.
> 
> Note 2: Edited transaction data with dates that have not happened yet **will be treated as corrupted data**, so do avoid adding
> transactions that have not happened yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates 
with the file that contains the data of your previous SuperTracker inventory.

**Q**: What if I want multiple items with the same name? 
What if I want different batches of the same item with different expiry dates?

**A**: Simply add a unique identifier after the item name when creating a new item. 
e.g. `n/Milk-1`,`n/Milk-2`. The format of the unique identifier is completely up to the user's discretion.

**Q**: Why can't I add new items to the inventory using the buy command?

**A**: The buy command should mainly be used when you want to replenish the stock of an existing item.
If you wish to add a newly bought item to the inventory, 
first create a new item in the inventory with its quantity set to 0 using the [new](#create-a-new-item-new) command,
then use the buy command to increase its quantity.

**Q**: Why am I allowed to set the quantity and/or price of an item to 0?

**A**: We want to provide our users with more flexibility. 
This can be handy for placeholders or situations where items are free.

**Q**: Why am I allowed to set expiry dates that have already passed?

**A**: We want to provide our users with more flexibility.
This can be useful if the user has previously entered an incorrect expiry date, 
allowing them to fix their mistake.
